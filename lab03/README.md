## Linear Regression Practice
=============================

### Part 1:

1. Recreate the linear regression example shown in class-- [SciKit-Learn Linear Regression Demo](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gads14-nyc/fall_2014_assignments/blob/master/lab03/linear_regression_demo.ipynb)
- Start a *new* iPython notebook and type the commands from scratch!
- Play with the numpy methods-- try to find alternate ways to accomplish the same thing
- Play with the input values, see what changes
- *Bonus* Try to find another way to generate random training data

Don't forget to save your work!

### Part 2:

2. Load the [Boston housing dataset](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gads14-nyc/fall_2014_assignments/blob/master/lab03/data/Boston.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame

Answer the following questions using python, numpy, and pandas.
1. Determine the min, median, mean, max for each numeric feature in the data set.
2. Sort the data frame by each column (aside from Name), and print the results of each. What interesting trends exist in this data set, based on distributions?

3. Repeat the process from *Part 1*, by picking a feature (DataFrame column, X) and see if you can fit a regression line that predicts `medv` (y)
