### Yet More Data Science References

There are so many things you could read! Here are some more that didn't get put in the [short list](data_science.md).

 * [The Field Guide to Data Science](http://www.boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/media/file/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science.pdf) was put together by Booz Allen Hamilton and is oriented perhaps toward an executive or semi-technical audience; it does include a wide range of topics and reads comfortably, like a magazine.
 * [Building data science teams](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/building-data-science-teams.html)
 * [2013 Data Science Salary Survey](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/stratasurvey.pdf)
 * [How to Start Thinking Like a Data Scientist](http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/11/how-to-start-thinking-like-a-data-scientist/) is about using data whether or not you use a fancy algorithm.
 * [Data Science Workflow: Overview and Challenges](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/169199-data-science-workflow-overview-and-challenges/fulltext) describes workflow with some complexity.
